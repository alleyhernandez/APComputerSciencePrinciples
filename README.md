# AP Computer Science Principles Coursework

This repository serves as a digital portfolio of my work and progress in the AP Computer Science Principles course. The course is an introductory college-level class designed to broaden participation in the field of computer science.

## Course Overview

AP Computer Science Principles aims to introduce students to the essential ideas of computer science and show how computing and technology can influence the world. The curriculum covers a variety of topics that range from fundamental concepts of computing to the latest innovations in the field.

Throughout the course, I have engaged in the creative aspects of programming, developed algorithms, and constructed solutions to problems. A significant focus has been on understanding how data is used in computational processes to create new knowledge and on incorporating the principles of abstraction into program design.

## What's Inside
